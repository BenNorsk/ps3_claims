# Problem Set 3: Claims modelling exercise

Ben's recommendation to initialise the environment:
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate ps3
```
Additionally, you may add the precommit hooks.
The official recommendations are given below.
```
mamba env create
conda activate ps3

pre-commit install
pip install --no-build-isolation -e .
```
